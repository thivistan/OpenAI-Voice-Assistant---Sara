## Sara - Voice-Controlled Desktop Assistant

Sara is a voice-controlled desktop assistant powered by Python. It can assist you with tasks like setting reminders, creating to-do lists, searching Wikipedia, performing web searches, and even interact with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model for answering questions. This project is designed to provide a user-friendly and hands-free experience for various tasks on your computer.

### How to Use Sara

1. Install Required Libraries: Make sure you have installed the necessary Python libraries by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition wikipedia openai
   ```

2. Set Up GPT-3 API Key: You need to obtain an API key from OpenAI and replace the `openai.api_key` variable in the code with your key.

3. Voice Settings (Optional): If you prefer a different voice for the assistant, you can modify the `voiceChange()` function to select the desired voice index.

4. Run the Code: Execute the Python script, and Sara will greet you and be ready to assist.

### Functionalities

- **Reminders:** Ask Sara to remind you about specific tasks at a given time. It will notify you when the time arrives.

- **To-Do List:** Create a to-do list by telling Sara the tasks you want to include. She will read it back to you for confirmation.

- **Wikipedia Search:** Ask Sara to search for a topic on Wikipedia, and she will provide a brief summary of the topic.

- **Web Search:** Request Sara to search the web for any specific topic, and she will open the search results in your default browser.

- **GPT-3 Interaction:** Interact with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model by asking Sara questions. She will speak the answers generated by GPT-3.

### Note

Please note that the GPT-3 interaction requires a working API key from OpenAI, and this code assumes you have the necessary permissions to use their service.

### Dependencies

- pyttsx3: Text-to-speech engine to allow Sara to speak.
- speechrecognition: Library for recognizing speech input.
- wikipedia: Provides access to Wikipedia's API for topic summaries.
- openai: Allows interaction with the GPT-3 language model.
